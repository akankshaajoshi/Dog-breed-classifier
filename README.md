# Dog-breed-classifier
Dog breed classifier using different architectures (resnet, vgg, and alexnet) to correctly identify whether the image is of a dog and its breed.

Description: Dog breed classifier using different neural network architectures is the first project for the AI Programming in Python nanodegree offered by Udacity.

Tools used: Python, Linux, and Tensorflow.

Working: 
-1. Collect the data (images and labels).
-2. Associate labels from the names of the training data by creating a dictionary.
-3. Using the associated labels, feed the data to the neural network.
-4. Calculate metric scores for the classifier.
-5. Predict results using the best chosen classifier.
