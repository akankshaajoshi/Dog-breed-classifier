Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, even though the different architectures managed to correctly identify the images of dogs, the breeds were differnet.
VGG: Toy poodle
AlexNet: Miniature poodle
ResNet: Miniature poodle


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the differnet architectures identified both the breeds of Dog_01 and Dog_02 to be the same.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all the model architectures correctly identified Cat_01 and Urn_01 to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Alexnet worked the best for classification of the images.
It has a slightly lower runtime than the other two classifiers and provides results closer to the actual one, similar to resnet.
